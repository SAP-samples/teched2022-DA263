# Exercise 2 - Launch Business Decision Simulator and run simulations

Duration: approx. 15 minutes

In this exercise, we will run simulations in Business Decision Simulator to analyze how different influencers impacts the probability of certain scenarios.
After completing these steps you will have run several simulations and have the respective probabilities of the outcomes.


## Exercise 2.1 Load the simulation model into Business Decision Simulator.
1. In [Business Decision Simulator](https://budesi-techedsac-da263.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com/) open the modelling view.

2. Navigate to  **Models** tab and load the simulation model "XXX". //ADD NAME //NO MODEL AT THE MOMENT

> In case the model is not imported in the system, please follow the instructions below to upload it manually. 
> - In the modelling view, navigate to "Models" tab and use the import functionality

> - Navigate to downloaded file on your local environment abd open file to upload.

> - Name the simulation model XXX and save it. The simulation model is successfully imported when it 
is listed under "Models".

3. The factors of "spend_data.xlsx" are modelled as a knowledge graph. The knowledge is used to compute probabilities of the scenarios. You can observe the model by zooming-in or you can select one node and see to which other node it is connected.

## Exercise 2.2 Change value of influencer and run simulations

1. Adjust data range of the "Base Resin - PPI Coefficient" influencer to 0.3 by entering the value in the text field. //FIND AND ADD VALUES

2. Run the simulation.

3. The simulation is now executed and the results are displayed. Explore the details of the scenarios by expanding "Details" section.

4. Take a moment to view the results. What do you think?

## Exercise 2.3. Play around with the simulator
1. Now, it is time to play around with the simulation capabilities. Adjust the values of the influencers as you like, re-run the simulation and observe the outcome.

## Summary

You've now run your first simulations.
