# Exercise 4 - Optimize outcome

Duration: approx. 15 minutes

In this exercise, we will explore the optimization actions suggested by the system.
After completing these steps you will have applied one optimization action to your simulation results.

## Exercise 4.1 Optimize outcome by evaluating the optimization actions

1. The system suggests various optimization actions based on optimizing variables that can be controlled. In comparison, all factors on the left side are not controllable. Expand the optimization action section to view the following three optimization action:
- Obtain Supply Chain Resiliency by splitting Volume to 2 Suppliers equally
- Obtain higher Saving Amount by ordering 20% more from current Supplier
- Simulate the expected Saving Amount Manually by adjusting Volume

2. Following optimization action 3, you can manually manipulate the "Volume" influencer factor. Re-run the simulation and observe the outcome.

## Summary

You've now further optimized the probabilities of the outcomes.
