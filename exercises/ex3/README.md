# Exercise 3 - Run simulation and readjust influencing parameters

In this exercise, we will 

After completing these steps you will have created...

## Exercise 3.1 Change value of influencing parameters

1. In your web browser, open [Business Decision Simulator](https://budesi-spend-connect.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com/?mid=spend_connect_-_packaging).

2. Adjust data range of the "Base Resin - PPI Coefficient" influencer to 0.3 by entering the value in the text field

3. Run the simulation by clicking **Run Simulation** button.

4. The simulation is now executed and the results are displayed.


## Exercise 3.2 Run simulation and view results

1.	Explore the details of the scenarios by expanding **Details** section.

2. Take a moment to view the results. What do you think?

## Exercise 3.2 Play with the simulator, re-adjust influencing factors and run the simulation again.

1. If you like to play around with the simulator, open [Business Decision Simulator](https://budesi-spend-connect.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com/?mid=spend_connect_-_packaging) in a new tab in your browser. Get familiar with the simulation capabilities by adjusting the values of the available influencers or creating new nodes as you like and observe the outcome. (?)

2. Come back to your initial tab with the model created and influencers adjusted according to the exercise so far.

2. Re-adjust the "Base Resin - PPI Coefficient" influencer to 0.1 by entering the value to the text field.

3. Re-run the simulation by clicking **Re-run simulation** button.

## Summary

You've now ...
